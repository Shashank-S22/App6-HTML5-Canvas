Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Goal is to learn how to use Javascript + HTML + CSS to manipulate pictures, text, and drawing shapes. 
 
Known Issues:
Biggest known issue was adding the image onto the canvas, since we had to figure out a way to define image without actually pasting into the website after the button was clicked.
